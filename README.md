# Predictive-Model-and-Potential-Agents-for-CRC-Immunotherapy-
we introduces an immune subtype classification based on diverse immune cells and pathways, paired with a robust predictive model constructed through machine learning to evaluate the sensitivity of patients with CRC to immunotherapy. Validation of this model across public datasets and clinical samples confirmed its high precision and reliability.
